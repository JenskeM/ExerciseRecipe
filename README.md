# Exercise: Git Branching
We are now going to learn how to create a branch on Github and merge it with main.

1. Find a recipe from: The Happy Pear
2. Create a new repository as you did before. Make sure to create a README.md - either automatically using GitHub, or by creating, committing, and pushing it yourself.
3. You will then create a recipe.md file in this repository containing the recipe.
4. The contents of this file should be written in Markdown (which is used by many developers).
5. Clone the repository to your computer.
6. Create a new branch called ingredients.
7. Check out your new branch.
8. Put the ingredients in recipe.md . on your computer.
9. Customize.
10. Commit.
11. Push to your branch.
12. Go to GitHub and see your branch appear.
13. Create a Pull Request to merge your branch to main.
14. Merge your branch to main.
15. On your computer: navigate from your branch to the main branch again.
16. Get the new ingredients by doing a git pull.
